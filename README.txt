NOTE: This program was created with CLION which is free with a .edu email

To run:
Put all files in zip in a directory.

compile with gcc or g++

Ensure c++17 is installed
use -std=c++17 or -std=gnu++17 to compile

-03 and -stdc++fs must be used in compile arguments
(-stdc++fs maybe not as it is already in the CMakeLists.txt)

CMakeLists.txt is crutial to run the program
CSCE4200 inside the CMakeLists.txt fuke us tge target and executable

To include the files needed, go to file_paths.h and enter int the file paths on the respective string

For the ft911 directory, only ft011_1, ft011_2, and ft011_3, are able to be read in presently
I have no idea why this is and had no time to fix.


Run the program to tokenize and index the files and after this is done,
the program will prompt the user to enter in a word to find.
The program will return the the docs that the closest words are found in.
